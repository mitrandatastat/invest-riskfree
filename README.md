# Risk Free Investment

This repository contains a Machine Learning project where a predictive model is developed based on skewed data using supervised learning algorithm. The model offers highly reliable risk-free investment suggestions to the conservative investors. 

#### Objectives

Below is the list of questions that we are looking to answer as a final outcome of this project:

* To generate featured data and provide a prediction whether a particular loan will be fully paid off on time or not, based on developing a Predictive Model using Skewed/Imbalanced Credit Risk data set applying a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm. 


### Goal Significance

Why do investors need to know the certainty of getting a loan paid off? What benefit could be derived by developing an accurate loan delinquency prediction model? 

We can highlight the below mentioned goals: 

1.	The investors, especially conservative investors, tend to stay away from any risky investment opportunity where the probability of default or charge off is high. They want to be assured of their lending will be paid off on time and per the T&C agreed upon.

2.	Investors also desire not to miss any promising business opportunity due to a faulty predictive model, where it is highly likely that the load would get paid off on time.

### Technical Writeup

Please refer to the approprite portion of the portfolio section to read the [**Detailed Project Write up**](https://portfolio.mshah.info/risk-free-investment/). 

### Code Explanation

Once get fork permission:

* Download the .py file and 'databank' folder together.  

* Retain the relative folder tree structure. 

* The native python file (.py) shuold remain in the root directory.

* The python file extracts data from one .csv database and one .xlsx data file that exist in the databank folder. 

* Execute the .py file in root. 

* During execution, two .csv files would be created in the root folders for the appropriate reasons mentioned in the code: 
	
	1. cleaned_loans_2007.csv
	2. filtered_loans_2007.csv

Please feel free to contact me for any of your question or concern through github. Happy coding. Enjoy!
